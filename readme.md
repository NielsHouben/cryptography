## rsa

TLDR;
Rsa abuses the fact that no efficient algorithm for factoring algorithm is known.

Quantum computers might break this though...


## prime gen

Implemented the math from [this website](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory/millerrabin.html#:~:text=The%20Miller%2DRabin%20test%20picks,Rabin%20test%20is%20at%20most%20.)

does have false positives and number is not guaranteed to be prime, however it is extremely likeley.
